ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eliana Gimenez.

I'm a junior Data Analyst and my goal is to become a data scientist.

I studied journalism because I wanted to tell real stories. But I've decided to make a change in my career when I discovered programming and how I could communicate real stories from real data through data analysis and data visualization.

So I did the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python (Udemy) and now Iâ€™m learning how to make the most of pandas, matplotlib and other libraries by doing new projects that interest me.

I'm currently working as a BI Developer and I'm learning how to develop machine learning models through Python. 

If you want to connect with me you can send me an email to elianagimenez9@gmail.com
